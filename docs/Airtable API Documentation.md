# Authentication

## [§](/developers/web/api/authentication\#basics) Basics

Airtable's API uses token-based authentication, allowing users to authenticate API requests by inputting their tokens
into the HTTP authorization bearer token header.

Example:

```

curl https://api.airtable.com/v0/YOUR_BASE_ID/YOUR_TABLE_ID_OR_NAME -H \
"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

All API requests must be authenticated and made through HTTPS.

Passing personal access tokens and OAuth access tokens via the legacy `api_key` URL parameter is not supported.

## [§](/developers/web/api/authentication\#types-of-token) Types of token

> As of February 1st 2024, the deprecation period for Airtable API keys has ended. Users of Airtable API keys must
> migrate to the new authentication methods to continue using Airtable's API. See [this article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/airtable-api-key-deprecation-notice)
> for more details.

We currently support using personal access tokens and OAuth access tokens during the authentication process.

[Personal access tokens](/developers/web/guides/personal-access-tokens) are for personal development, like building an integration for
yourself, your client, or your company. They can be created and managed at [/create/tokens](/../../create/tokens) or
from the enterprise admin panel for [service accounts](https://support.airtable.com/docs/service-accounts-overview). Personal access tokens act as your user account, and should not
be shared with third-party services or integrations.

[OAuth access tokens](/developers/web/guides/oauth-integrations) are recommended for building an integration where other users grant your
service access to Airtable’s API on their behalf. In this case, your integration is a third-party service with respect to Airtable.
After registering your integration with Airtable at [/create/oauth](/../../create/oauth), tokens are available
via the [OAuth grant flow](https://oauth.net/2/).

Any integrations that allow other users to grant access to Airtable should use OAuth.

## [§](/developers/web/api/authentication\#scopes-and-resources-access) Scopes and resources/access

Personal access and Oauth tokens serve as the account of the user who grants access, with the following limitations:

- [Scopes](/developers/web/api/scopes): What actions the token can perform.
- Resources/access: What bases and workspace the token can access. Tokens can be granted access to individual—or all—bases/workspaces. These can be listed using the [list bases](/developers/web/api/list-bases) endpoint.

For example, to update a record in a base via API, the user who granted the token must have editor access to the base.
Additionally, the token must have both the correct scope ( `data.records:write`) and the base added to it as a resource.

For personal access tokens, scopes and resources/access are individually configured from [/create/tokens](/../../create/tokens).
And for OAuth access tokens, developers choose the requested scopes from [/create/oauth](/../../create/oauth),
while end-users decide what resources to grant access to.

# Scopes

Scopes control what actions a token can perform.

[Personal access tokens](https://airtable.com/developers/web/guides/personal-access-tokens) and [OAuth access tokens](https://airtable.com/developers/web/guides/oauth-integrations) can only access API endpoints covered by the scopes granted to them. A full reference of available scopes is below.

**Note**: By default, OAuth integrations can only request basic scopes. See [here](https://airtable.com/developers/web/guides/oauth-integrations#making-api-requests) for more information about requesting enterprise scopes.

On top of requesting the correct scope, the user and token must also have the required resources and permissions to perform the action.

Example 1: a personal access token with the scope `data.records:read` and a base added to it would be able to use the "Read records" endpoint on that base, but would not be allowed to use the "Write records" endpoint for that base. Similarly, it would not be able to use the "Read records" endpoint to access other bases that have not been added to the token.

Example 2: a personal access token with the scope `schema.bases:read` and multiple bases added to it would only be able to create fields in bases where the user has Creator permissions (required to customize fields).

For more information on how tokens work, refer to the [Authentication](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/authentication) reference.

# Errors

The Airtable Web API follows HTTP status code semantics.

2xx codes signify success, 4xx mostly represent user error, 5xx generally correspond to a server error. The error messages will return a JSON-encoded body that contains **error** and **message** fields. Those will provide specific error condition and human-readable message to identify what caused the error.

## [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#success-code) Success code

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-200-ok)`200 OK`

Request completed successfully.

## [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#user-error-codes) User error codes

These errors generally indicate a problem on the client side. If you are getting one of these, check your code and the request details.

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-400-bad-request)`400 Bad Request`

The request encoding is invalid; the request can't be parsed as a valid JSON.

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-401-unauthorized)`401 Unauthorized`

Accessing a protected resource without authorization or with invalid credentials.

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-403-forbidden)`403 Forbidden`

Accessing a protected resource with API credentials that don't have access to that resource.

See [below](/developers/web/api/errors#anchor-403) for examples and suggested debugging steps.

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-404-not-found)`404 Not Found`

Route or resource is not found. This error is returned when the request hits an undefined route, or if the resource doesn't exist (e.g. has been deleted).

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-413-request-entity-too-large)`413 Request Entity Too Large`

The request exceeded the maximum allowed payload size. You shouldn't encounter this under normal use.

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-422-invalid-request)`422 Invalid Request`

The request data is invalid. This includes most of the base-specific validations. You will receive a detailed error message and code pointing to the exact issue.

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-429-too-many-requests)`429 Too Many Requests`

The API is limited to 5 requests per second per base. You will receive a 429 status code and a message "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later" and will need to wait 30 seconds before subsequent requests will succeed. To learn more about rate limits, please visit our [Rate Limits](/developers/web/api/rate-limits) guide.

## [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#server-error-codes) Server error codes

These errors generally represent an error on our side. In the event of a 5xx error code, detailed information about the error will be automatically recorded, and Airtable's developers will be notified.

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-500-internal-server-error)`500 Internal Server Error`

The server encountered an unexpected condition.

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-502-bad-gateway)`502 Bad Gateway`

Airtable's servers are restarting or an unexpected outage is in progress. You should generally not receive this error, and requests are safe to retry.

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-503-service-unavailable)`503 Service Unavailable`

The server could not process your request in time. The server could be temporarily unavailable, or it could have timed out processing your request. You should retry the request with backoffs.

## [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#example-error-responses) Example error responses

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-404)`404`

The path is not valid.

```

404 Not Found
{
  "error": "NOT_FOUND"
}
```

```

404 Not Found
{
  "error": {
    "type": "NOT_FOUND"
  }
}
```

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-403)`403`

You don't have the right permission for the resource, or the resource was not found.

Check that both you and the token have access to the resource. For example, to access a base using a personal access token,
your user must be a collaborator _and_ the token must also have access to the base. See [this guide](/developers/web/api/authentication#scopes-and-resources-access) for more details.

```

403 Forbidden
{
  "error": {
    "type": "INVALID_PERMISSIONS_OR_MODEL_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Invalid permissions, or the requested model was not found. Check that both your user and your token have the required permissions, and that the model names and/or ids are correct."
  }
}
```

You don't have permission to create records in the given table. This is returned both when creating records directly,
and when creating linked records while updating cell values.

Check whether the table or any fields you are setting values for have [editing permissions](https://support.airtable.com/docs/using-field-and-table-editing-permissions) limited.

```

403 Forbidden
{
  "error": {
    "type": "INVALID_PERMISSIONS",
    "message": "You are not permitted to create records in table TABLE_NAME (TABLE_ID)"
  }
}
```

You don't have permission to update cell values in the given field. Check whether the field has [editing permissions](https://support.airtable.com/docs/using-field-and-table-editing-permissions) limited.

```

403 Forbidden
{
  "error": {
    "type": "INVALID_PERMISSIONS",
    "message": "You are not permitted to write cell values in field FIELD_NAME (FIELD_ID)"
  }
}
```

You don't have the right permission for the action.

```

403 Forbidden
{
  "error": {
    "type": "INVALID_PERMISSIONS",
    "message": "You are not permitted to perform this operation"
  }
}
```

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-422)`422`

The path is correct, however the body is either not understood or not permitted.

```

422 Unprocessable Entity
{
  "error": {
    "type": "INVALID_REQUEST_UNKNOWN",
    "message": "Invalid request: parameter validation failed. Check your request data."
  }
}
```

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-429)`429`

The request has been rate limited.

```

429 Too Many Requests
{
  "error": {
    "type": "RATE_LIMIT_REACHED",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later"
  }
}
```

### [§](/developers/web/api/errors\#anchor-503)`503`

The server is temporarily unavailable and the request should be retried. The `Retry-After` header may be provided.

```

503 Service Unavailable
{
  "error": {
    "type": "RETRIABLE_ERROR",
    "message": "Server encountered an error while processing your request, and it is safe to retry the request"
  }
}
```

Records

# List records

get `https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableIdOrName}`

List records in a table. Note that table names and table ids can be used interchangeably.
We recommend using table IDs so you don't need to modify your API request when your table name changes.

The server returns one page of records at a time. Each page will contain **pageSize** records, which is 100 by default.
If there are more records, the response will contain an **offset**. To fetch the next page of records, include **offset** in the next request's parameters.
Pagination will stop when you've reached the end of your table. If the **maxRecords** parameter is passed, pagination will stop once you've reached this maximum.

Returned records do not include any fields with "empty" values, e.g. **""**, **\[\]**, or **false**.

You can filter, sort, and format the results with query parameters. Note that these parameters need to be URL encoded.
You can use our [API URL encoder tool](https://codepen.io/airtable/pen/MeXqOg) to help with this.
If you are using a helper library like [Airtable.js](https://github.com/Airtable/airtable.js), these parameters will be automatically encoded.

**Note** Airtable's API only accepts request with a URL shorter than 16,000 characters. Encoded formulas may cause your requests to exceed this limit.
To fix this issue you can instead make a POST request to `/v0/{baseId}/{tableIdOrName}/listRecords` while passing the parameters within the body of
the request instead of the query parameters.

Records

# Update multiple records

patchput `https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableIdOrName}`

Updates up to 10 records, or upserts them when `performUpsert` is set (see below).

The URL path accepts both table names and table IDs. We recommend using table IDs so you don't need to modify
your API request when your table name changes.

A `PATCH` request will only update the fields included in the request. Fields not included in the request will be unchanged.
A `PUT` request will perform a destructive update and clear all unincluded cell values.

### [§](/developers/web/api/update-multiple-records\#upserts) Upserts

Set the `performUpsert` property in your request to enable upsert behavior. When upserting is enabled, the `id` property
of records becomes optional. Records that do not include `id` will use the fields chosen by [`fieldsToMergeOn`](/developers/web/api/update-multiple-records#request-performupsert-fieldstomergeon)
as an external ID to match with existing records.

- If zero matches are found, a new record will be created.
- If one match is found, that record will be updated.
- If multiple matches are found, the request will fail.

Records that include `id` will ignore `fieldsToMergeOn` and behave as normal updates. If no record with the given `id` exists,
the request will fail and will not create a new record.
The API response for upsert requests will additionally include `updatedRecords` and `createdRecords` arrays, indicating which records
in the `records` array already existed and were updated, or did not exist and were created, respectively.

Airtable reserves the right to throttle upsert requests differently from the [standard rate limit throttling policy](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/rate-limits).

### [§](/developers/web/api/update-multiple-records\#typecasting) Typecasting

Set the `typecast` parameter to `true` to enable typecasting. When typecasting is enabled, Airtable will try to convert string values
in a record's `fields` object to the appropriate cell value. This conversion is only performed on a best-effort basis.
Typecasting is disabled by default to ensure your data's integrity, but it may be helpful when integrating with third-party services.

Records

# Update record

patchput `https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableIdOrName}/{recordId}`

Updates a single record. Table names and table ids can be used interchangeably.
We recommend using table IDs so you don't need to modify your API request when your table name changes.
A **PATCH** request will only update the fields you specify, leaving the rest as they were.
A **PUT** request will perform a destructive update and clear all unspecified cell values.

Your request body should include a **fields** property whose value is an object containing your record's cell values, keyed by either field name or field id.

Automatic data conversion for update actions can be enabled via **typecast** parameter. The Airtable API will perform best-effort automatic data conversion
from string values if the **typecast** parameter is passed in. Automatic conversion is disabled by default to ensure data integrity,
but it may be helpful for integrating with 3rd party data sources.

Creates multiple records. Note that table names and table ids can be used interchangeably.
We recommend using table IDs so you don't need to modify your API request when your table name changes.

Your request body should include an array of up to 10 record objects. Each of these objects should have one key
whose value is an inner object containing your record's cell values, keyed by either field name or field id.

Returns a unique array of the newly created record ids if the call succeeds.

You can also include a single record object at the top level.
