AIRTABLE TABLE CREATION RULES

When creating Airtable tables through the MCP server, you must follow these strict rules:

1. NEVER create multiple complex fields in a single table creation request. Instead:
   - Start with basic text fields only (singleLineText, multilineText)
   - Add complex fields one at a time using create_field
   - Wait for confirmation after each field creation before proceeding

2. Field Type Requirements:
   Basic Fields (no options needed):
   - singleLineText
   - multilineText
   - email
   - phoneNumber

   Complex Fields (require options):
   - number: requires {"precision": 0} for integers
   - currency: requires {"precision": 2, "symbol": "$"}
   - date: requires {"dateFormat": {"name": "local"}}
   - singleSelect: requires {"choices": [{"name": "Option", "color": "colorBright"}]}

3. Creation Order:
   a. Create table with basic text fields
   b. Add number/currency fields
   c. Add date fields
   d. Add select fields
   e. Verify each field after creation

4. Error Recovery:
   - If a field creation fails, do not proceed to the next field
   - Verify the field options match exactly as specified
   - Try creating the failed field again with corrected options

Always proceed step by step, waiting for confirmation after each operation before continuing to the next.

Example Workflow:
1. Create table with basic fields:
   - Product Name (singleLineText)
   - Description (multilineText)

2. Add number field:
   - Stock (number with precision 0)

3. Add currency field:
   - Price (currency with precision 2)

4. Add date field:
   - Launch Date (date with local format)

5. Add select field:
   - Category (singleSelect with choices)

Never attempt to combine these steps or create multiple complex fields at once.
```
